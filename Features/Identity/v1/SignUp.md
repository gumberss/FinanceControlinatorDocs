### Details
- The customers can give their email, username and password
- When click in the button "I want to be part", the user is registered in the server-side
- Do not be mean with my UX. Please :)

### #Future 
- When the button "I want to be part" is clicked, It's not showing to the user that a request was made and the app is waiting the response. It's not so good :/ #TechnicalDebit
