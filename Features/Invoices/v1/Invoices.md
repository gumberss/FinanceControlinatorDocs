## What
The invoices fature is to able the customers to mange their purchases in a month control, just like an invoice is!
But, what we want here is not only able the user to see their monthly invoices, but an onverview about how their are using their money.

## How
- The most important thing is present to the customer their invoices (actual and futures). without it, the customer won't be able to know where their money is going to.
- The second feature is to create an [[Invoices Overview|overview]], able users to have insights about their purchases.
