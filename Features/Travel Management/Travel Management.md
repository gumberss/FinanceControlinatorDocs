##  [[Travel Management]] Overview
Status: #OnlyIdea #Discovery

This idea is to manage they travel with finance controlinator, all the travel costs, places and so on.

### How to start
- The first step is to discovery the main features, what will bring more impact and create a small app with some simple features and layout, but enough to manage the travel costs 
- Draw a screen and understand how user want to see their costs
	1.  Probably the costs will be grouped by travel and the user will tell us how much money they will spend with the item
	2. Create a bar to able user follow their travel objectives

## Thinking:
- New microservices grouped by BU?
- When the travel planning is created, should we create a future expense, is it considered a piggy bank or should be other microservice?
	1. Create a piggy bank for entire travel or for each item (probably for the entire travel)



## What is needed?
- New microservice (s)
- Create templates
- Think better in the features :D
