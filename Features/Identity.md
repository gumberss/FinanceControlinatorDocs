## Problem definition
The application today can be used for only one perso (me :D), but in the real world, we usually want more than one person use our systems.

## Goals / Motivations

- When we develop a system, we want that more than one person use our system, this is a important thing in the system architectures nowadays, so I think this is a important feature for this system.




## Plan
### Remember that:
1. Steps can be add at any time
2. When every step is done, should be a reference to document, PR, Commits or other think that make other understand how it was made 

### Steps
 1. Discover which is the best way to go on
