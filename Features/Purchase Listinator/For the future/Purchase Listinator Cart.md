## Maybe a command cart?
- I'm thinking on it because it can solve a sync process, instead of have a cart with a state, I'll have a cart with the commands the user made and every time I want to sync what the "Buyer user" and the "List maker user" are doing, I just get the current state of the list made by "List maker user" and apply all the commands make by the "Buyer user" and return it to the buyer user. The sync is made
- It may help to understand the order the customer usually get the items in that place
	- What could I do with it?
		- Order the list by last purchase order
