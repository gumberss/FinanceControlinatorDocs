- How the events were saved on the Shopping Cart module 
	- [#157](https://github.com/gumberss/PurchaseListinator/issues/157)
	- Why use set in this case?
- Uncouple shopping and purchase list [#154](https://github.com/gumberss/PurchaseListinator/issues/154)
- The controller output schema can't be set because it can be either the result or a left
	- Create our own left/right/branch to have the control and the schemas
- The request (components.http/request) does not consider the status to parse the result-schema. 
	- The result schema should be for each status
- The shopping cart will create the price suggestion events on the cart
	- It requests the price suggestion only when the cart is created
	- It  Doesn't make sense to request every time a item is created or other moment
- Why the shopping cart listen the shopping close event instead of listen a HTTP post 
	- Because if something happen between the close-cart request and the shopping closed event publication, we lost all the events forever
