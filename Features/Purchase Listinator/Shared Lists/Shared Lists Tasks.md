This is the designated space for organizing the shared list task. Our strategy involves categorizing them into epics, facilitating a clear understanding of the workflow, and ensuring prompt delivery of features to customers while gathering their valuable feedback. Each epic corresponds to a specific feature we aim to deliver, with multiple associated tasks to be completed. While it is possible to initiate a new epic concurrently with an ongoing one, our preferred approach is to prioritize the completion of the current epic before commencing a new one. However, if there are no remaining tasks that can be worked on simultaneously, it is acceptable to initiate a new epic to prevent developers from being idle.
