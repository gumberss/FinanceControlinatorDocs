At the first view, Purchase Listinator is a software that enables the customers to buy the items inside the list in an organized way through the categories and the ordination of the items. But it is not the main purpose. The main purpose is to make the customer purchase be correctly registered empowering the customer finance control, simplifying the hard parts of the registration through a simple interaction between the customer and the app, decreasing the friction. 

One of these frictions is the price that the customer needs to add every time. The initial test of the Purchase Listinator, showed to us how boring it can be to fill this field. 

The point that increase the friction is the need of the customer to fill the item price every time, even though the customer filled it last time he bought the item.

As was mentioned before, the Purchase Listinator's main purpose is to help the customers register theirs purchases in the right way, and reducing this friction can make the customer registration more assertive. The idea is to reduce the friction as possible, because the bigger the friction, the smaller the customer finance control precision, because the customer will fill in the wrong way or just don't fill it.


___

At this moment, we are aware that the customer will need to fill at least the first time the item is bought. Once we already have the initial price, we can work with it to reduce the friction for the customer. 


- If the customer doesn't fill the right value, it is not possible to make the correct control of the customer finances
- This is one of the most important challenges to ensure the correct finance control at this moment
- Try to guess the price as near as possible of the real value
- The price can change every time
- Drag down and up to decrease/increase the value (mobile component)?
